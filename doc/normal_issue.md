# Error Usage

## Error code example

#### error #1: create multiprocess out 'if __name__ == "__main__"' of entry script
- Code/Function that you do not want to run in new process must be written/called under 'if __name__ == "__main__"' of entry script, 
  or it will run/called in new process.
- Following last note, multiprocess_for must be called in a function called under 'if __name__ == "__main__"' of entry script. 
  Otherwise, new processes will be generated recursively util crashed.
  
```py
from multiprocplus import multiprocess_for, MultiprocessRunner

def func(a, b):
    return a * b

N = 100
A, B = list(range(N)), list(range(N))

# => run in single process
C = [func(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B)]
print(sum(C))
# => run in multiprocess
C = multiprocess_for(func, [(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B)], num_process=3)
print(sum(C))
```
it will get output/bug as:
```shell

    RuntimeError: 
            An attempt has been made to start a new process before the
            current process has finished its bootstrapping phase.
    
            This probably means that you are not using fork to start your
            child processes and you have forgotten to use the proper idiom
            in the main module:
    
                if __name__ == '__main__':
                    freeze_support()
                    ...
    
            The "freeze_support()" line can be omitted if the program
            is not going to be frozen to produce an executable.
```

#### error #2:

- Following last note, multiprocess_run must be called in a function called under 'if __name__ == "__main__"' of entry script. 
  Otherwise, new processes will be generated recursively

```python
from multiprocplus import multiprocess_for

func1 = lambda a, b: a*b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = 100
    A, B = list(range(N)), list(range(N))

    def func(a, b):
        return a * b

    # => run in single process
    C = [func(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B)]
    print(sum(C))
    # => run in multiprocess
    # error usage 1:
    C = multiprocess_for(func1, [(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B)], num_process=3)  # error but no error info report
    # error usage 2:
    C = multiprocess_for(func, [(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B)], num_process=3)
    print(sum(C))
```

if function is **lambda function**, the multiprocess_for will **failed to run, but no error info report**;
if function is not global, it will get such output/bugs as:
```shell
